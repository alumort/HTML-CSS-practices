        <p> There's many things to do at any beach we go, enjoying the warm sun and cooling breezes. For example, we can visit the beach at different times of the day to see beautiful colors all around the sea </p>

            <li> <strong> Beaches</strong> come in different sizes, so it's best to get up early to get a good spot to lay on. </li>
            <li> You can play with the sand, swim at the sea, or just lay down to get a nice suntan. </li>
            <li> Of course, you can also just walk around: It's a better experience if you bring someone with you to talk about all the beautiful views you see!</li>
            <li> Sometimes, people come to sell food to you at the beach, like fresh fruit or smoothies made with them. </li>
