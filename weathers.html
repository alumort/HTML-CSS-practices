<p> In our planet, there's different types of weather which sometimes affect our mood, the place, or even our activities according to what's happening around us. Temperature is also affected by weather.
<br> Here's some examples, which I'll discuss afterwards.</p>
<table> <thead> <tr> <th> Weather </th> <th> Feeling </th> <th> Opinion </th> </tr>
<tbody> <tr> <td> Rainy </td> <td> Nostalgic </td> <td> Makes me lazy </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> Sunny </td> <td> Optimistic </td> <td> It's nice until the sun becomes unbearable </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> Cloudy </td> <td> Calm </td> <td> My favorite type of weather </td> </tr>
